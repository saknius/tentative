A sigmoid function gives an output between zero to one for every input it gets
. These sigmoid units are connected to each other to form a neural network.
The first step in building our neural network will be to initialize the parameters. We need to initialize two parameters for each of the neurons in each layer: 1) Weight and 2) Bias.
